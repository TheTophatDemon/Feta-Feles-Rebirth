This code is licensed under GPL3.

The game was originally supposed to be released for a game jam, but the project scope bloated and the full product ended up taking about 3 months to make. Thus, there are some sloppy coding decisions and minimal comments. If there are any particular questions about how the code works, feel free to contact me at tophatdemonproductions@gmail.com.
